Phonemes that are sometimes omitted during speech are written between

Each two-part vocabulary record is delimited from others
with LF (ASCII 10).

SPECIAL FEATURE OF THIS LEXICON:
several hundred words pronounced differently because of
their part-speech have been distinguished. For example,the entries:

close/v kl/oU/z  and  close/aj kl/oU/s
(terminal sibilant varies)or
effect/n '/I/,f/E/kt  and  effect/v ,/I/'f/E/kt(stress varies)

distinguish those two parts of speech. (Any word with this
information will terminate with the virgule (slash) in the vocabulary
field, followed by one ormore of the following part-of-speech
abbreviations:n, v, av, aj, interj, followed by the rest of the
pronunciation record.
